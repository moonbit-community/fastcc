# MoonBit Language Skill & Prompts

MoonBit is a young language with frequently changing syntax and standard library. Popular LLMs often need carefully crafted system prompts or skills to write high-quality code.

The official prompts are verbose and consume many tokens, with much content that LLMs already know. This project provides concise, useful entries instead.

## Usage

**Option 1**: Insert the contents of [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) into your system prompt to prevent AI from writing outdated or anti-pattern code.

**Option 2**: Install the full `moonbit-lang` skill, which contains more complete and up-to-date MoonBit syntax and best practices.
